# Vanguard

Project has been built with NX and NgRx as per the job description
I'm following the offical NX enterprise-angular-mono-repo-patterns guide. See PDF in the root of the folder

I would normally make the design more responsive but in the essense of time it's just postion: absolute for now

Instead of the angular test bed I've used [Spectator](https://github.com/ngneat/spectator)

For testing observables I've used [observer-spy](https://github.com/hirezio/observer-spy)

I added github and github actions as an after thought so my check in history isn't ideal
